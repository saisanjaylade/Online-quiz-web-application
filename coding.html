                <p>Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

                    A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters. 
                    <br><b>Input:</b> digits = "23" <br>
                    <b>Output: </b>["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

                <p>Jack and Jill are playing a string game. Jack has given Jill two strings A and B. Jill has to derive a string C from A, by deleting elements from string A, such that string C does not contain any element of string B. Jill needs help to do this task. She wants a program to do this as she is lazy. Given strings A and B as input, give string C as Output.</p>

                <p>Example 1: <br>
                    
                    <b>Input:</b><br>
                    tiger     -> input string A <br>
                    ti        -> input string B <br>
                    <b>Output:</b>
                    ger       -> Output string C <br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
                    After removing "t" and "i" from "tiger", we are left with "ger".
                    So, the answer is "ger".

                <p>Mahesh and Suresh are playing a new game “Checkers“. This is a very simple game but becomes challenging when more expert players are playing. Below is the description of the game and rules: The game is played by 2 players. This game consists of an N*M matrix. Each of the cells is background lit by lights. And these cells are either Green or Black. The green and black cells are randomly lit and will be represented with 1's and 0's respectively. Green cells are the cells that need to be captured. Black cells cannot be captured. Everyone is in the race to capture the maximum number of cells possible.
                    In a single chance, a player can capture all those adjacent cells which share an edge. Once there is no adjacent edge the chance breaks and the next player will play.<br>
                    Mahesh always starts the game and Suresh is second.
                    Both players are playing optimally, find out how many cells Suresh captures.</p>

                <p>Example 1: <br>
                    
                    <b>Input:</b><br>
                    2 2       -> Input integer, N, M<br>
                    1 1       -> Input integer, A[i]<br>
                    1 1       -> Input integer, A[N]<br>
                    <b>Output:</b>
                    0          -> Output<br>
                    <b>Explanation:</b><br>
                    In the above scenario, it is very clear that if Mahesh plays first, he will capture all the cells as all the cells are adjacent to each other.
                    There will be nothing left for Suresh. Hence the cells captured by Suresh will be 0.
                    <b>Hence the answer is 0.</b>
